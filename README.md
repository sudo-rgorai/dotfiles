# My system dotfiles
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sudo-rgorai/dotfiles/main/demo.png?token=ANVI7KJ6A5TELAXBRSBJCMDBQ7EJG)
- I often hop distros, change DEs/WMs, experiment on new tools and consequently break my system sometimes evidently losing my dotfiles. This repository contains some sensible defaults which I've grown fond of and can be a good starting point when I want to rice my system without reinventing the wheel every time.
- I haven't written most of these from scratch. They have been either heavily inspired or completely copied from popular repositories.
